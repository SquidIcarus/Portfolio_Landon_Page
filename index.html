        <p>
            Filipino born and involuntarily adopted. DNA test suggests a bit of Irish in the mix. Always hungry and willing to work for flavor. Raised in a family of music and food, and continue to honor the traditions of music and food. Constantly on the move as a child around asia, but mostly kept in cities near the pacific ocean. City kid at heart but will always find time for open country and nature to keep the balance.

            <p>Raised with Filipino and southern American soul food, I was rolling lumpia as soon as I was able to stand on a stepstool.</p>

            <p>Family gatherings consisted of too much food, whiskey and jam sessions.</p>

            <p>Grandma on the piano, dad on the guitar, uncles and cousins showing up with various stringed and wind instruments.</p>

            <p>I always wanted to be a drummer, but instead I picked up guitar and piano as they were always around.</p>

            <p>Still want to be a drummerâ€¦</p>
