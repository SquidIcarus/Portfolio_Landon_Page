# First Code Review

## Landon's Profile Landing Page

This project is created to display what I have learned in the first two weeks at Epicodus.

## Main objectives for this project

    - Utilize simple HTML tags

    - Include a custom-made stylesheet that uses typograhy styles, box model (including margin, border and padding), and floats

    - Clean code, well-refactored and easy-to-read with correct indentation, spacing and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.

    - Commits are made regularly with clear messages that *finish* the phrase **"It will..."**

    - Project repo contains a README with all of the necessary information.

    - Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.

    - Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.

    - The prompt's required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

## What's the purpose?
This page was created with HTML and CSS for the purpous of being code reviewed at © Epicodus, Inc.

## Headaches and issues while creating this page

- Was able to apply img and text to banner, couldn't get it right in main about me section.

- Site looks best at 100% zoom, some boxes and txt overlap at different zoom points.
